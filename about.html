        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>~~~~~~~~~~</h3>
        <p>My name is Alexis, I was born in 2005 on August 29th. Although I wasn't born in Oakland i've lived here for as long as I can remeber. Something that I do all the time when im bored is draw. I also recently got into painting which i wouldn't say im great at but i think i'm pretty decent at it. I'd say that one of the most important things to me is friendship and trust, I wouldn't say I have many friends because I only trust a certain amount of people. I'd say that im a pretty ok student and I currently have straight A's which im really proud of. </p>
